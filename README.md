# Building, querying and visualizing an Amazon RDS database of COVID-19 data

In this small project I'll build a cloud database on Amazon RDS containing Covid-19 provided by Our World in Data. 

The project will comprise the following steps:

- Building a mySQL database on Amazon RDS using the free tier;
- Upload OWID data to the database with Python;
- Query the database with SQL;
- Visualizing the output of the queries in R.
